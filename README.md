# Personal Finance Application Development

## Problem Statement

*Many young students face constant financial challenges due to limited income and a lack of experience in managing personal finances. Without a structured system to track spending, it is easy to lose sight of where money is going, leading to overspending and struggling to achieve financial goals, such as saving for tuition, rent, or personal activities.*

## Project Objectives

This application will be a personal management tool, curated to user’s needs to help with financing, tracking income and expenses, and provide methods of reaching personal financial goals. We will ensure that the application is easy to use with a clean, user-friendly design displaying graphs to help visualize spending amounts.

Our project seeks to accomplish the following objectives:

- Develop a user-friendly application that empowers users to easily track and manage their expenses, providing a fun and engaging way to control their spending.
- Provide users with insights into their spending patterns
- Allow users to automatically log expenses by using a receipt scanner, which saves time and reduces human error.

## Stakeholders

The success of this project depends on collaboration and support from the following stakeholders:

- Project Developers:  Salam Al-Rifaie, Darren Lee, Zahra Mohamed, An Pham, Brandon Pham.

## Project Deliverables

Description: Our project will yield a finance management application designed to simplify expense tracking by allowing users to scan receipts, which are automatically logged and categorized. This is achieved through advanced text scanning machine learning and categorization algorithms, ensuring accuracy and efficiency. The app offers a fully gamified experience, including achievement badges, an XP progress system, and daily financial challenges to enhance user engagement.
